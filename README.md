# Unplayable

Synopsis: Unplayable is an arena shooter in the style of quake. Instead of damage, the weapons cause negative effects to the visuals, audio or inputs of your opponents, and the objective is to make their game so unplayable (hence the title) that they fall off the map, or walk into an environmental hazard, which causes their death.

The game is aiming to be fast paced and easy to pick up and play, this makes it easy to get into, however there is still going to be a high skill ceiling, leading to the possibility of a competitive scene (think of Smash Bros or Rocket League)

Aesthetic - I'm thinking it wants to be between TF2 (which is too cartoony and over the top) and Quake (which is too bland) - something along the lines of Overwatch, Ratchet and Clank or Zelda games such as Twilight Princess - far from realistic, but not a saturday morning cartoon either.

Characters - There's two ways we could do this and I don't have my heart set on either. Option 1 is to have set characters that are able to be customised to an extent with skins and sets (i.e. Dota 2 style). Option 2 is to have complete character customisation within set parameters (i.e. Sims, or possibly less complex like Rocket League). Option 2 allows for more player customisation but for balance reasons would mean that every character would have to play more or less the same. Option 1 would allow us neat gameplay tricks such as different characters having 'specialities' with different weapons, or access to a different kind of grenade, or different running/jumping abilities, for some examples off the top of my head. Option 2 is obviously easier to balance, so that's my initial preference, but there are strong benefits to option 1 too!

Arenas - As an arena shooter with no real need for a story, the locations can be as inventive as we are! You can go from a map on top of a tree to a map over an active volcano, or a space station where jumping too high could make you float away! Each arena must have thematic consistency with itself though, we don't want half the map in a futuristic city and the other half as a renaissance depection of heaven! Also, for the gameplay to work, the majority of each arena should have no walls, no ceilings, and lots of holes in the floor! Falling off the map is the main way that people will lose, so a rule from day 1 is to make sure that's possible! Arenas should be large enough to still have downtime in a hectic 4v4 match, but constructed with a lot of paths around them so that it's not too hard to find the action.

Weapons - As a general rule, weapons do not do damage in Unplayable. Instead they cause various negative effects, that, when stacked together make the game so unplayable that you die. The more effects a player currently has, the stronger any new effect will be, including displacement effects, so you can get that 'Smash Bros' feeling of stacking a load of effects onto one guy and then punching them into space.

Unplayable is drawing heavy inspiration from classic arena shooters, so as such, each player starts with only a melee weapon (probably just their fists, because that example above isn't nearly as funny when it's with a knife or a sword) - additional weapons are found on weapon spawn points around the arena but each weapon has limited ammunition, so staying on the move and picking up new weapons is a must, and experience with the full armoury the game has to offer is a good way of setting apart a new player and a seasoned one.

Weapon ideas - Any sort of weapon is a valid candidate to have an effect thrown onto it. One thing I'd like to avoid is having weapons that all have the same effect but are on different guns - so if there's a knife that makes the screen sepia tone then we don't need a pistol and a shotgun that also make the screen sepia tone. However, 5 different rocket launchers that do different things is totally fine! (Of course, the models for all of these would need to be significantly different for clarity)

The scope of this game allows us to basically use any weapon we want to, nothing would look out of place from a submachine gun, to a laser rifle, to a throwing knife or even a mystical headband that allows your character to breathe fire!

Another guideline I'd like to set early is that if possible the name of a weapon should be a pun, a joke, a mickey take of a gaming trope or something similar. There's a lot of comedy potential here, and it's a nice simple way of adding a load of character to the game.

So, every weapon idea should have: A funny name, the type of weapon it is, and the effect. (I didn't do all this with the originals, but I've added it in now)

The original idea from the thread that inspired this was a parody of Planetside, which we can adapt, as that particular example does a little too much. I think it's best to split it into two different effects - limiting the frame rate and downscaling the resolution are both great ideas, but it's too strong for it to do both at the same time, and anything that causes an 'instant loss' such as a disconnection effect should be avoided, so I think we should drop the 3rd bit all together. So, for now, consider this turned into:

'CEB: Cinematic Experience Bomb' - A remotely detonated stick of C4 that limits the framerate of anyone in the blast radius to 24fps

'Downscale Darts' - A blowdart pipe

We also have... my original ideas (copy and pasted here for convenience)

'Shrink Ray' - A futuristic ray gun that fires a slow moving but wide circular projectile. Get hit with it and your game starts to run in a window 1/4 the size of your screen.

'Pea Shooter' - Literally a pea shooter. Think Dennis the Menace. A rapid fire weapon that can fire as quickly as you can press P on your keyboard. (Note: Because of my later thoughts on weapons not doing damage, an alternate version of this is that each pellet spins the opponent to a random direction and knocks them back a tiny bit)

'Hand Cramp Hand Cannon' - A large revolver. Randomly changes your key layout to either QWERTY, AZERTY, QZERTY, or if you're really unlucky, Dvorak. Your bindings, however, do not change.

'Doubler Jump' - Spring boots that last for 5 jumps. Land on your opponent's head and any inputs they give are given twice.

'Negative Nancy' - A rocket launcher that inverts the colours of the blast radius, if you're hit by it all your colours are inverted. (Note: 'Inverted' may be the wrong word.. I was meaning more of an 'accessibility mode' colour scheme)

'Mirror Bomb' - A grenade, this one reverses your walk bindings - try to go left and you'll go right, try to go forwards and you'll go backwards. One axis is reverted to normal before the other one, but you're not sure which and it's always random.

Ideas from /u/Durawkz

'Stand Tall' - getting shot with this gun disables your crouch button.

'Sticky Bomb' - being unfortunate enough to get hit with this sticky grenade activates sticky keys, minimizing your game. (Note: As much as this would be hilarious, it may be a little too strong.. There's probably a way to make this work though!)

'Molasses Bomb' - getting caught in this mine's blast radius will make the last key you pressed get "stuck" to being pressed down until you are killed, or get a kill.

'Decoy Gun' - Whoops! You picked up the decoy gun! Now there's a beacon activated around you, and you're revealed on radar. This gun will self destruct in 10 seconds. Hurting you for 40 hp, and ending the revealing. (Note: No damage, so perhaps it amplifies everything you're hit by for the next X seconds, and also doesn't allow you to do anything offensive for the duration because trying to fire this just makes a 'bang' flag come out the end.)

'Nostalgia Beam' - anyone hit by this old-school gun must type out each action into a text-based game console in order to move, shoot, crouch, etc. (Note: This would have to be balanced by being very rare and only having one shot, as well as not lasting for very long unless the person hit with it already has a lot of effects stacked up! Also, this has to be an 8-bit style model!)

'The Drainer' - every shot from this gun drains the target of 1 bullet from their ammo reserves!

Early thoughts on monetisation - Probably kickstarter, and then probably either cheap or free to play with cosmetic only microtransations for character customisation. Dota style steam workshop support for everything: Maps, weapons and cosmetics can all be designed by the community with the best ones getting into the game for real. If this does take off then everyone that helps will of course be compensated fairly, but we can sort that out at a later date.

So, who do we have so far?

N.B. if your name is on this list I'm not expecting you to suddenly drop everything and make this, it's merely an indication that you expressed an interest in making this silly little game a reality! I expect that, at least for now, we'll all be doing this in our free time (myself included) so let's not set any goals in terms of timeframe for now, don't even think about it yet, just throw ideas around!
